Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the Puerto Rico Fiscal and Economic Growth Plans (FEGPs), which were prepared in October 2018, and certified by the Oversight Board. In line with assumptions of this plan, IMF projections assume federal aid for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in September 2017. The projections also assume revenue losses from the following: Puerto Rico will lose federal funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) starting in 2020; federal tax incentives, which were neutralizing the effects of Puerto Rico?s Act 154 on foreign companies, will begin to decline starting in 2018; and the effects of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which reduce tax advantage of U.S. companies producing in Puerto Rico will narrow this revenue base. Given sizable policy uncertainty, some FEGP and IMF assumptions may differ, in particular, those relating to the effects of the corporate tax reform, tax compliance and tax adjustments (fees and rates); reduction of subsidies, freezing of payroll operational costs, improvement of mobility, and reduction of expenses; and increasing health care efficiency. On the expenditure side, measures include extension of Act 66, which freezes much government spending, through 2020; reduction of operating costs; decreases in government subsidies; and spending cuts in education. Although IMF policy assumptions are similar to those in the FEGP scenario with full measures, the IMF?s projections of fiscal revenues, expenditures, and balance are different from FEGP?s. This stems from two main differences in methodologies. First, IMF projections are on an accrual basis, FEGP?s are on a cash basis.
